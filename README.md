# permute
---
A repository with scripts to permute a possible string hashed in digest algorithm. Currently only md5 suppoted.
<br>
# USE WITH RESPONSIBILITY. ONLY FOR CTFs

---
To use test this library, enter a hash in the `permutation` script, and wait.
It will find the string, but patience is needed.

<br>
Keep a few points in mind:

* It is still in development. 
* No dependencies.
* Tested on PyPy3 and Cpython.No C extensions, cffi, cythonizing, etc.
* Quite time consuming.

**The developer is NOT responsible** for misuse of this program for unethical use  by any user  . This is intended for **CTF solving PURPOSES ONLY**.
